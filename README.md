This repo contains the project to create the page above, which showcases particles animated with music.

This is created using the node-based WebGL engine [Polygonjs](https://polygonjs.com), and can be edited or adapted without any coding required. But if you know how to code, you can also extend [the open source engine](https://github.com/polygonjs/polygonjs) by [creating your own nodes](https://github.com/polygonjs/plugins_tutorials).

I'm preparing a tutorial on how to create this type of effect, which I'll release on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/fradingue) and [@polygonjs](https://twitter.com/polygonjs) in a few days.

# Open Polygonjs Editor

- 1: install dependencies, with `yarn` or `npm install`
- 2: run: `yarn polygon` or `npm run polygon`
- 3: open your browser on `http://localhost:8091?scene=scene_01`
- 4: you should see this:

![Polygonjs Editor](https://github.com/polygonjs/tutorial_audio_analysers/blob/main/public/images/editor.jpg)

- 5: you are then asked to login, but you can cancel/skip it and still use the scene. But you need to login in order to save your changes.

- 6: And then press play to start the music and particles simulation:
