This repo contains the project to create page above, which showcases particles animated with music.

This is created the node-based WebGL engine [Polygonjs](https://polygonjs.com), and can be edited or adapted without any coding required.

I'm preparing a tutorial on how to create this type of effect, which I'll release on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fradingue) in a few days.
