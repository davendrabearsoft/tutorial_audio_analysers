Created with [Polygonjs](https://polygonjs.com)

I'm preparing a tutorial on how to create this type of effect, which I'll release on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fradingue).
# Open Polygonjs Editor

- 1: install dependencies, with `yarn` or `npm install`
- 2: run: `yarn polygon` or `nom run polygon`
- 3: open your browser on `http://localhost:8091`

If you have any trouble installing it, the docs may be able to help: [https://polygonjs.com/docs/](https://polygonjs.com/docs/)
